# Enhanced Company Cards - Development

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Start Development Server:**
   ```bash
   python3 dev-server.py
   ```
   This will start a server on http://localhost:3000

2. **View Enhanced Cards:**
   - Main app: http://localhost:3000/index.html
   - **Enhanced cards dev**: http://localhost:3000/dev-enhanced-cards.html

## 🎯 What's New

### Enhanced Tabbed Structure

The new company cards include 6 tabs with better organization than Companies House:

1. **🏢 Overview** - Company snapshot with risk indicators
2. **👥 People & Control** - Officers, PSCs, and control structure  
3. **🔒 Securities & Risk** - Charges analysis with amounts and risk scoring
4. **📊 Financials** - Filing history and compliance status
5. **📅 Activity Timeline** - Recent activity and upcoming requirements
6. **🔍 Advanced Insights** - Risk assessment and calculated metrics

### Key Improvements Over Companies House

- **Risk-first approach** - Clear risk indicators in header
- **Better information hierarchy** - Related data grouped logically
- **Calculated insights** - Risk scores, tenure analysis, compliance scoring
- **User-friendly language** - Technical jargon explained
- **Progressive disclosure** - Simple overview → detailed analysis
